                The Reds have been relatively quiet in the January transfer market with Cody Gakpo
                joining on January 1

            <p class="description">But there has been very little activity apart from that at Liverpool and there will
                be no
                signings before the
                window shuts on Tuesday night.
            </p>
            <p class="description">Asked after
                <a
                    href="https://www.football365.com/news/brighton-2-1-liverpool-mitoma-scores-wonderful-winner-to-knock-the-holders-out-fa-cup">
                    their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the fourth round of the FA Cup</a>
                if Liverpool
                will make any signings before the deadline, Klopp said: “No, nothing will happen in this transfer
                window.”
            </p>
            <p class="description">And he doesn’t appear to be bluffing with <a
                    href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/transfernews/article-11695555/Liverpool-NOT-recruit-deadline-day-focusing-efforts-Jude-Bellingham-summer.html">
                    the
                    Daily Mail reporting that</a> Liverpool ‘do not
                plan to bolster Jurgen Klopp’s squad before the close of the January transfer window’.
            </p>
            <p class="description">Instead, they will concentrate ‘all efforts’ on negotiations to bring Borussia
                Dortmund
                midfielder Jude Bellingham to Anfield in the summer market.
            </p>
            <p class="description">Liverpool, who sit ninth in the league, are currently ten points off fourth-placed
                Manchester United in the Premier League table with leaders Arsenal a further 11 points clear.
            </p>
            <p class="description">And many fans and pundits reckon they need to strengthen their midfield now if they
                want
                to qualify for the Champions League next season.

            <p class="description">But the Daily Mail add: ‘Despite the need for change now,
                Liverpool’s pursuit of
                Bellingham in the summer remains the absolute priority, and the Anfield chiefs believe no midfielder
                available this month sizes up to the 19-year-old in terms of quality. ‘</p>
            <p class="description">Emmanuel Petit agrees about midfield being a problem for Liverpool “to a certain
                extent”
                but the former Arsenal midfielder reckons the loss of Sadio Mane to Bayern Munich has been played down
                too
                much.</p>
            <p class="description penult-description">Petit told <span>ICE 36</span>: “I’ve heard many
                people say that Liverpool’s midfield
                has
                struggled
                this season, and I agree with that to a certain extent. Liverpool have played with such power and energy
                for
                five years – they’ve been tremendous – but some players look tired on the pitch and are not delivering
                the
                same levels as we’ve seen them before, but I think the main reason Liverpool are not the same is Mane.
            </p>
            <p class="description">“Since Mane left, Liverpool are not playing the same way. Mane was such an important
                link
                between Liverpool’s midfield and attack. He played with so much energy on the pitch. He was decisive and
                always contributed with goals and assists. He led the Liverpool press and scared defenders when they had
                the
                ball. He set the tempo of the team and everyone else followed, Salah did the same job.</p>
