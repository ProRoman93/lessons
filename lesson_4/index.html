		<p class="text">The Ukrainian Armed Forces claimed Tuesday to have "liquidated" 850 Russian servicemen during
			the last day of
			fighting and raised to more than 127,000 the total number of Russian soldiers killed since the beginning of
			the
			invasion, a figure that contrasts with the one provided by Moscow, which has not updated its casualty toll
			for
			weeks.</p>

		<p class="text">The General Staff of the Ukrainian Army has pointed out in a message published on its official
			account on the
			social network Facebook that since the outbreak of the war on February 24, 2022, 127,500 Russian servicemen
			have been "liquidated", while 3,201 battle tanks, 2,197 artillery systems and 221 Russian anti-aircraft
			defense systems have been destroyed.</p>

			missiles, 18
			vessels, 5,048 vehicles and fuel tanks and 200 pieces of "special equipment" have also been destroyed. "The
			data is being updated," he stressed.</p>
		<p class="text">Russia has not provided data on casualties in the conflict since September, when Russian Defense
			Minister
			Sergei Shoigu confirmed the deaths of 5,937 servicemen. The Russian news portal Mediazona puts the total
			death toll at 12,538, figures it considers "corroborated" by publicly available data.</p>
